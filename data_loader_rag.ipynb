He rose from \\na small-town boy to one of the most successful captains in cricket history, proving that dreams, when chased with passion \\nand dedication, can turn into reality.\\n\\nMahendra Singh Dhoni, often known simply as MS Dhoni, is one of the greatest cricketers in the history of the game. \\nHe was born on 7th July 1981 in Ranchi, Jharkhand, India. Dhoni is celebrated not only for his exceptional cricketing skills \\nbut also for his calm demeanor, sharp decision-making abilities, and inspirational leadership on and off the field.\\n\\nDhoni made his debut for the Indian cricket team in December 2004 against Bangladesh. He initially caught attention with his \\naggressive batting style, unorthodox wicket-keeping, and ability to finish matches under pressure. Over the years, he transformed \\ninto a complete cricketer and one of the finest captains cricket has ever seen.\\n\\nKnown as 'Captain Cool,' Dhoni led the Indian team to several historic victories. Under his leadership, India won the inaugural \\nT20 World Cup in 2007, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, making him the only captain to have \\nwon all three major ICC trophies. He also captained India to the top of the ICC Test rankings in 2009. His tactical brilliance, \\nability to stay calm in tense situations, and knack for backing young talent set him apart from other leaders.\\n\\nAs a batsman, Dhoni is remembered for his finishing ability. He was renowned for chasing down totals and guiding India to \\nvictory in high-pressure matches. His unbeaten 91 in the 2011 World Cup final against Sri Lanka remains one of the most iconic \\ninnings in Indian cricket history. His unique 'helicopter shot' became famous worldwide and reflected his innovative approach \\nto batting.\\n\\nBeyond his international career, Dhoni made a massive impact in the Indian Premier League (IPL). As the captain of the \\nChennai Super Kings (CSK), he led the team to multiple IPL titles and playoff appearances. His connection with CSK fans runs \\ndeep, and he is adored as 'Thala' in Chennai, meaning 'leader' in Tamil. His calmness, humility, and loyalty towards the \\nfranchise made him an IPL legend.\\n\\nOff the field, Dhoni is known for his simplicity and grounded personality.

       "'Tesla, Inc. ( TEZ-lə or   TESS-lə) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services.\\nTesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk led Tesla\\'s first funding round and became the company\\'s chairman; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023.\\nTesla is one of the world\\'s most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. Starting in July 2020, it has been the world\\'s most valuable automaker. From October 2021 to March 2022, Tesla was a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to reach that valuation. Tesla exceeded $1 trillion in market capitalization again between November 2024 and February 2025. In 2024, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 17.6% share. In 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.\\nTesla has been the subject of lawsuits, boycotts, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company\\'s driving assist technology and product release timelines. In 2025,  opponents of Musk have launched the \"Tesla Takedown\" campaign in response to the views of Musk and his role in the second Trump presidency.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Founding (2003–2004) ===\\nThe company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. They served as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively. Eberhard said that he wanted to build \"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company\", with its core technologies as \"the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor\".\\nIan Wright joined Eberhard and Tarpenning a few months later. In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12.5 million in 2024) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10.8 million in 2024) from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla. J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.\\nA lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.\\n\\n\\n=== Roadster (2005–2009) ===\\n\\nElon Musk took an active role within the company, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. The company\\'s strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.\\nIn February 2006, Musk led Tesla\\'s Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team. Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay president Jeff Skoll. A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.\\nIn August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon '"
